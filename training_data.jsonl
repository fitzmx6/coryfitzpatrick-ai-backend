{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Cory handle feedback and criticism?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cory actively seeks and responds well to feedback, viewing it as essential for growth. He implements feedback loops through regular one-on-ones, retrospectives, and code reviews. He's open about his own areas for improvement, like his initial tendency to give answers too quickly rather than coaching engineers to find solutions themselves. He's actively addressed this by implementing a coaching-first approach: when time permits, he now gives engineers space to investigate problems independently and asks them to document what they tried before coming to him. Initially, he found team members hadn't investigated issues and just expected immediate answers. To change this pattern, he started requiring engineers to document their investigation steps and learnings in tickets before seeking help. He also invested time pairing with engineers to demonstrate his investigation and problem-solving process, teaching them how to learn independently. This approach has led to measurably higher team engagement and faster learning across the team. When he receives feedback, he listens without being defensive, asks clarifying questions to fully understand, and takes concrete action to improve. He also gives feedback effectively to others - directly but respectfully, focused on behaviors and outcomes rather than personalities, with specific examples and constructive suggestions. His military background taught him the importance of honest feedback for improvement and mission success.

Most importantly, his teams actually enjoy working with him - he's received multiple peer bonuses and awards for collaboration and leadership. He brings the rare combination of getting results while building healthy, high-performing teams."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has Cory evolved his coaching and mentoring approach over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cory has demonstrated significant growth in his coaching philosophy. Early in his leadership journey, he recognized a tendency to give answers too quickly rather than coaching engineers to discover solutions themselves. Rather than accepting this as his style, he deliberately evolved his approach. He implemented a structured coaching methodology: when time permits, he gives engineers room to investigate problems independently before intervening. When team members come to him with questions or issues, he asks them to first document what actions they took to investigate the problem. Initially, he found engineers hadn't investigated at all and simply expected immediate answers - which he often had. To break this dependency pattern, he established a practice requiring engineers to document their investigation steps and learnings in tickets before seeking help. He also invested significant time pairing with engineers to demonstrate his own investigation and learning process, effectively teaching them how to fish rather than giving them fish. The results have been measurable: the team shows higher engagement levels and learns concepts faster with this coaching-first approach. This evolution showcases Cory's commitment to continuous improvement, his willingness to address his own developmental areas, and his focus on building truly independent, capable engineers rather than creating dependency on his technical knowledge."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Cory build psychological safety on his teams?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cory builds psychological safety through deliberate actions and modeling the behavior he wants to see. When he first joined the J&J team, he observed that engineers were afraid to add comments in PRs because they didn't want to offend anyone, and team members wouldn't speak up when they didn't understand his directions - partly due to cultural differences on the distributed team. To address this, he took several concrete steps: First, he openly admitted when he didn't know something, modeling vulnerability and showing that not knowing is acceptable. Second, he was strict but fair in code reviews, sometimes marking PRs as 'needs work' when significant changes were required - not to be harsh, but to ensure quality standards were maintained and issues couldn't be merged unresolved. He explained that constructive criticism isn't mean, it's necessary for improvement. Third, he consistently demonstrated that questions and pushback were welcome and valued. Over time, he saw measurable changes: team members became more open about not understanding him and would ask clarifying questions instead of proceeding with uncertainty. Engineers became significantly more active in PR discussions, adding thoughtful comments and suggestions. Most importantly, the team developed a greater sense of code ownership, taking pride in their work and feeling invested in the codebase quality. This transformation didn't happen overnight, but through consistent modeling of the values he wanted to instill - vulnerability, high standards with kindness, and welcoming diverse perspectives."}]}

The project showcases his passion for continuous learning and his ability to quickly master new technology stacks. He implemented a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using: FastAPI for the backend web framework, Groq API with Llama 3.1 8B Instant for ultra-fast LLM inference, ChromaDB as the vector database for semantic search, Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for generating embeddings, Redis for caching to improve performance, SlowAPI for rate limiting protection, and deployed it to Railway with optimized build times. He taught himself vector embeddings, semantic search, prompt engineering, and how to build production-ready AI applications. The chatbot demonstrates his technical versatility - he went from backend Java and React development to building a Python-based AI application. He optimized the system for performance, achieving sub-1-second response times and implementing caching strategies that make repeat queries 99% faster. This project exemplifies his approach to learning: hands-on, practical, and focused on building real solutions rather than just theoretical knowledge. It also shows his ability to quickly pick up new frameworks and deliver production-quality applications, even in domains outside his primary expertise."}]}

One engineer described their first demo with Cory supporting them, which gave them so much confidence and helped them grow tremendously. Engineers particularly appreciate that Cory never makes them feel bad about mistakes - even when they make plenty of them - but instead always shows them the right way forward and has their backs. His mentees describe him as truly listening no matter how busy things get, making time for regular one-on-ones where they feel heard. Engineers report learning a ton from him, with specific mentions of learning the importance of unit testing through his encouragement. Cory provides growth opportunities by encouraging engineers to explore new areas - allowing frontend engineers to take backend tickets if they express interest, and vice versa. He celebrates small wins and gives credit publicly, which mentees find highly motivating. Engineers describe feeling lucky to have had him as their tech lead and express that they really enjoyed working with him and the one-on-one talks they had.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Cory approach meetings and productivity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cory has a disciplined approach to meetings and productivity. He believes meetings are expensive and should count or be eliminated. He advocates for blocking out one full day of meetingless time per week when possible to enable deep work. He encourages or enforces an agenda for every meeting - if there's no agenda, he questions whether the meeting should happen at all. Before attending any meeting, he asks whether he will provide or get value; if neither, he doesn't attend. He defragments his day by rearranging meetings to be adjacent when possible, creating larger blocks of uninterrupted time. For productivity, he knows what he wants to accomplish each day and doesn't let interruptions drag him away from those goals. He uses a real prioritized task list rather than trying to use email for task management. He's invested in a system for containing email's impact, using organizational labels like @ACTION, @READ, @SOMEDAY, @URGENT, and @WAITINGFOR to reduce polling frequency and maintain focus. He figures out what he personally needs to maximize his energy level and manages that energy intentionally throughout the day. This disciplined approach allows him to balance leadership responsibilities with deep technical work and strategic thinking."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Cory give feedback to team members?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cory has a structured approach to giving feedback that ensures it's constructive and well-received. He always delivers feedback in person rather than through email or chat. He follows a specific formula: First, he shows his intent - explaining why he's giving the feedback and that it comes from a place of wanting to help. Second, he shows the data - providing specific, concrete examples of what he observed rather than generalizations. Third, he shows the impact - explaining how the behavior affects the team, project, or individual's growth. Finally, he ends with a question rather than a directive, inviting dialogue and ensuring the conversation is two-way. He never makes feedback personal - he focuses on behaviors and outcomes rather than attacking character or identity. This approach creates psychological safety where feedback is seen as a tool for growth rather than criticism. His team members appreciate his directness combined with respect, and the clarity of his feedback helps them improve quickly. He gives feedback with specific examples and constructive suggestions, always maintaining the person's dignity while addressing areas for improvement."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Cory make engineering decisions and express tradeoffs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cory understands that engineering is fundamentally about tradeoffs, and he's deliberate about understanding and expressing them. He believes making good engineering decisions requires weighing all available inputs and making informed decisions about trade-offs. He takes time to understand his own tradeoffs - what he values and why - as well as other people's tradeoffs, recognizing that different stakeholders may prioritize differently. When expressing tradeoffs to others, he's clear and specific, often documenting them so there's a shared understanding of what was considered and why certain paths were chosen. He evaluates decisions across multiple dimensions: latency (data freshness, response time), efficiency (resource utilization, SLOs), scale (coverage, new channels, expanded use cases), maintainability (long-term platform health, tech debt reduction, modern technology migration), and reliability/safety (monitoring, productionization, privacy, user trust). He doesn't let perfect be the enemy of good, understanding that shipping a good solution now is often better than waiting for a perfect solution later. He makes intentional decisions rather than defaulting to the status quo, and he documents the reasoning behind those decisions so future teams understand the context."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Cory pitch ideas and drive projects forward?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cory approaches pitching ideas strategically, starting early and often. He believes in communicating the problem and idea to build enthusiasm before diving into implementation. He addresses both technical and psychological barriers: technical challenges like competing organizational goals, other teams with different interests or schedules, team-level prioritization, and person-project match; and psychological barriers like sunk cost bias, fear of change or the unknown, bandwagons, cargo-cults, and organizational inertia. His pitching process follows stages: Idea (high level - is this plausible?), Research (explore details, establish key metrics, estimate project impact), Concept (crisp description of idea and why it matters), and Design (deep details, engaging Accountable, Consulted, and Informed parties). He focuses on convincing stakeholders that his idea is the best solution to the problem, then ends with a call to action and agreement on next steps. He clearly communicates success metrics - what does success look like and what metric clearly communicates impact? After getting buy-in, he keeps stakeholders informed through newsletters, milestone talks, and one-on-one updates. He keeps partner teams engaged by meeting with leads and staying current on dependencies and shifting priorities. He keeps his own team motivated by sharing organizational context and decisions while driving focus toward upcoming milestones. This comprehensive approach to pitching and project management has enabled him to drive significant initiatives like SBOM automation and verification process improvements."}]}
